# GTU
## Guess Test & Understand

the basic concept of this tasks is to provide you tricky examples
in JavaScript and make you think about them.
You always should start doing this task by just guessing the results
then test the examples in an environment and try to understand the
result even if your guessed result doesn't differ from test result.
